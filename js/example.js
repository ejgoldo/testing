const prompt = prompt("hello there this is your first JS code line created with the terminal");

console.log(prompt);

// don't like that at all. research if there is a way to start the cursor after the previously written code. 

// terrible, this isn't going to work for me. drawback from using vi. or maybe i just need to research more to see how to get the damn cursor under previously written text
