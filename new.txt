this is a new test file

idk if this worked, let's see if it did

alright so I still remember how to use the terminal as well as how to use git through the terminal.

next is making sure that I get how to use APIs. will be important so that I can continue practicing everything I have learned by making my own web site as well as side projects

I've slacked off once more and I am now behind once again. 
Need to get back to it
