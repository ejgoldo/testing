ok it is now the 9th of the month and i have not started project 5. need to start this asap so that I can be on schedule to finish project 6 this month as well.

now that the april vacation is cancelled, april can now be for project 7 and 8, thus leading to faster completion of the TD.

get on it

update!
ok, I started on project 5 and I am now reading my javascript book again. should be able to knock out 3 chapters, maybe 4, a day

this will refresh the basics and once I get the other book, I'll be able to read these often as well as have them as a reference

update!
alright, joined my compu's since I am not getting a new computer anytime soon. should be able to work better and get distracted a lot easier with this new setup

update!
ok, I have seriously been slacking in terms of project 5 since the last time I have done any coding on it was on Thursday. 
Let's get back to it and finish the project this coming week. This way, I can begin or get good progress on project 6 which will allow me to get through 7 and 8 next month.
Let's get cracking

update!
almost done with project 5
after that get started on 6 learning material as well as read the book that's going to be delivered friday as well as the book I have
should be on schedule if we can get through project 6 this month or be close to finishing it

-

update!
finished project 5 a couple of days ago. time to finsh reading the javascript book and move on to the one that just came in the mail.
keep on the reading and do peer reviews to remember past code. if you can also redo the previous projects, that should help as well.
let's get cracking!

-

update!
set up reminders on my calendar for reviewing previous projects and also doing peer review to boost and reinforce the knowledge.
starting chapter 6 today, kind of behind schedule but I will be in a much more quiet environment soon.
that should help but either way, no excuses. i have to finish this asap
