ok it is now the 9th of the month and i have not started project 5. need to start this asap so that I can be on schedule to finish project 6 this month as well.

now that the april vacation is cancelled, april can now be for project 7 and 8, thus leading to faster completion of the TD.

get on it

update!
ok, I started on project 5 and I am now reading my javascript book again. should be able to knock out 3 chapters, maybe 4, a day

this will refresh the basics and once I get the other book, I'll be able to read these often as well as have them as a reference

update!
alright, joined my compu's since I am not getting a new computer anytime soon. should be able to work better and get distracted a lot easier with this new setup

update!
ok, I have seriously been slacking in terms of project 5 since the last time I have done any coding on it was on Thursday. 
Let's get back to it and finish the project this coming week. This way, I can begin or get good progress on project 6 which will allow me to get through 7 and 8 next month.
Let's get cracking
