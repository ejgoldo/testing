ok it is now the 9th of the month and i have not started project 5. need to start this asap so that I can be on schedule to finish project 6 this month as well.

now that the april vacation is cancelled, april can now be for project 7 and 8, thus leading to faster completion of the TD.

get on it

update!
ok, I started on project 5 and I am now reading my javascript book again. should be able to knock out 3 chapters, maybe 4, a day

this will refresh the basics and once I get the other book, I'll be able to read these often as well as have them as a reference
